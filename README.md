# -Structured-Light-Fringe-Inpainting
In recent years, three-dimensional 3D scanning technology has been widely used in various levels. Among them, the gray code pattern structured light projection technology has been widely used in industrial inspection because of its good robustness and anti-noise. Gray code encoding technology directly projects a sequence of fringe pattern with specific intensity onto the scanned object, It is used to measure height distribution of the scanned object for further in-depth research operations. However, If the scanned object itself is a highly reflective metal object with strong specular reflection surface properties, tend to cause the acquired encoded fringe image to have local area encoding information lost. As a result, the measured point clouds ha a serious accuracy gap. To improve the quality of reconstruction results of highly reflective objects, this study proposes a new encoded fringe image inpainting technology. This technology develops a fringe-inpainting system based on generative adversarial network framework, Neural network is used to detect the area where the information is lost in the fringe images to repair the stripes. Finally, we compare the performance of fringe-inpainting system with other advanced highly reflective surface measurement technology. From the comparison, our proposed method significantly outperform other techniques, producing excellent encoded fringe inpainting for highly reflective objects.
