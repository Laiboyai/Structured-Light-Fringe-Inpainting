# Structured-Light-Fringe-Inpainting
In recent years, the gray code pattern structured light projection technology has been widely used in industrial inspection because of its good robustness and anti-noise. Gray code encoding technology directly projects a sequence of fringe pattern with specific intensity onto the scanned object, It is used to measure height distribution of the scanned object for further in-depth research operations. However, If the scanned object itself is a highly reflective metal object with strong specular reflection surface properties, tend to cause the acquired encoded fringe image to have local area encoding information lost. As a result, the measured point clouds ha a serious accuracy gap. To improve the quality of reconstruction results of highly reflective objects, we proposes a new encoded fringe image inpainting technology. This technology develops a fringe-inpainting system based on generative adversarial network framework, neural network is used to detect the area where the information is lost in the fringe images to repair the fringe features.
